## Cron Job

*currently broken help*

The currently implemented cron job runs `!update-all` once every **hour**. This ensures that everyone's stats are up to date with Hive all the time.

## Database

The database used is Postgres deployed on Heroku. The database has the following schema:

```
TABLE users (
    username varchar(255),
    ign varchar(255)
)
```

where `username` is the user's Discord username, and `ign` is their Minecraft in game name.
